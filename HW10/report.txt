best():
    Time Complexity: O(n^3)
    Space Complexity: O(n^2)
    Explanation: This function has a time complexity of n cubed because you must go through
        n^2 different substrings by adjusting i and j and for each substring you must go through
        it's length with k which is O(n) so O(n * n^2) becomes O(n^3). The space complexity is 
        O(n^2) because we have a dictionary that is 2 dimensional in the sense that their keys
        are tuples. this will result in n^2 values before it's over in the worst case.

    Explanation: This function has a time complexity of n cubed because you must go through
        n^2 different substrings, like the best, by adjusting i and j. For each substring you 
        must also go through its length with k which is O(n) so O(n * n^2) becomes O(n^3).
        The space complexity is O(n^2) because we have a dictionary that is 2 dimensional in the
