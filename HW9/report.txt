1. a. You can still implement Dijkstra's algorithm with python's heapq, although
    the time complexity would be worse as you would have to do a linear search in the 
    priority queue in order to find and update the distance values of nodes, which would
    change the complexity from O((V + E)log(V)) to O(V^2 + E).
    b. Dijkstra is a greedy algorithm as it makes locally optimal choices to find the shortest
    path then greedily expands the shortest paths from the source node to the other nodes. Although,
    dijkstra can be compared to DP problems as it has the same subproblem structure and results are 
    cached and updated throughout the algorithm.
    c. This depends on the problem that is being solved and it's characteristics. If you are looking
    for the shortest path in a graph that doesn't have negative weights then dijkstra will be better.
    Although, if you are looking for a sequence in which you can take classes then viterbi will be better.
